Program Design:
---------------
The program is architected using a client-server model. The server represents the battlefield and oversees missile strikes, while the client represents the soldiers and their actions.

How It Works:
-------------
1. Upon initialization, the server sets up the battlefield and randomly selects a commander from the available soldiers.
2. The client initializes soldiers with random positions on the battlefield.
3. Periodically, the server simulates missile strikes, determining their position and impact radius, then notifies the client.
4. Upon receiving this notification, the client decides the actions for each soldier, such as evading the missile.
5. If a missile strike results in the commander's death, a new commander is elected from the remaining alive soldiers.

Design Tradeoffs:
-----------------
1. Communication: We opted for XML-RPC due to its simplicity and ease of use for remote procedure calls.
2. Commander Selection: Random selection was chosen for fairness, though it might not always yield the most strategically placed soldier.
