Tests Conducted:
----------------
1. Test Case: Single Missile Strike
   - Input: Missile positioned at (5, 5) with a radius of 2.
   - Expected Output: Only soldiers within the impact radius are marked as dead.
   - Result: Successful. Verified by checking the alive status of soldiers post-strike.

2. Test Case: Commander Casualty

Known Limitations:
------------------
1. In scenarios where all soldiers are casualties, the program does not terminate gracefully.
2. Soldier evasion logic can be further optimized for better outcomes.
